/* the above program follows the requirement mentioned below :
1. main method:
a. Calls the method at step 2.
b. Must have a for loop in the main method so that we can use the program for
different people. Meaning that the method in step 2 must be called in a for loop
that repeats 10 times
2. A method that does the following: calculates and outputs the total number of calories
burned for a person based on the weight and amount of the time that the person did the exercises. This method must do the following in the given order
a. Get the userâ€™s weight in pounds
b. Call the method in step 3 to convert the pounds to kilograms. Store the result in a
variable
c. Get the amount of time running in minutes
d. Call the method at step 4 to get the calories burnt running. Make sure to pass
parameters to this method. And store the result in a variable e. Get the amount of time sleeping in hours
f. Call the method at the step 7 to convert hours to minutes. Store the result in a variable g. Get the amount of time playing basketball in minutes
h. call the method at step 6 to get the calories burnt playing basketball
i. add all the calories from different activities and display the result in 2 decimal points
using printf
3. A method that converts pounds to kilo. This method accepts the pound as its parameter
and returns the kilograms. One kilogram is equal to 2.2 pounds.
4. This method accepts the weight of the person and the amount of time running in minutes
and returns calories burnt running. Use the formula Calories/Minute = 0.0175 x MET x
Weight in Kilograms. MET for running 6MPH is 10.
5. A method that calculates the calorie burnt playing basketball. This methods accepts the amount of time playing basketball and the weight of the person in kilograms as its parameter and returns the calories burnt using the formula Calories/Minute = 0.0175 x MET x Weight in Kilograms . MET for I minute basketball is 8
6. This method gets minutes slept and the weight in Kilo and returns calories burnt while sleeping. Use the formula Calories/Minute = */
